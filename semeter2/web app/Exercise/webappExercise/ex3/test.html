          RM is the member of the group who feels most comfortable speaking
          English.<br />
          He taught himself by watching Friends with Korean subtitles over and
          over again. <br />
          If you watch interviews that are conducted in English, no doubt RM
          will be the one translating for the rest of the group.<br />
          He is also known as the leader because he was there from the start.
          <br />
          Other members of the group often describe their desire to learn from
          RM.

          If you ask why, you’re not using your goddamn eyes and it’s nothing
          related to Mr Worldwide. <br />
          He’s the oldest in the group but neces not the most mature. <br />
          He’s very very funny and if you choose a RUN BTS episode at random
          (RUN BTS is their TV show which features the band doing lots of
          challenges) it’s likely that Jin has come last. <br />

          Always got something enlightening to say. <br />
          Suga also has a career as a solo artist (like RM and J-Hope) in which
          he’s talked about mental health and his concern for young people.
          <br />
          He’s number one bias wrecker according to my extensive research.

          If your speakers were on 100% and then you added another 10 speakers,
          that’s how loud J-Hope is. <br />
          He’s got a lot of energy, he hates rollercoasters and scares easily
          but he is incredibly sure of himself and talented. <br />
          His recent mixtape Hope World featured a bop called Daydream which
          currently has 69million views on Youtube. <br />
